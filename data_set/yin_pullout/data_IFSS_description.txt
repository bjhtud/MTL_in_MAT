This experiment is a test of the interfacial properties of fiber-reinforced composites using the single fiber pullout method. In this test, an individual fiber is embedded in a polymer matrix, and a controlled force is applied to pull the fiber out from the matrix. The experimental parameters include 11 variables: fiber type, fiber diameter, embedded length, fiber Young's modulus, fiber Poisson's ratio, matrix type, matrix Young's modulus, matrix Poisson's ratio, loading rate, preparation temperature, and test temperature. The prediction target is the interfacial shear strength (IFSS).
For the type of fiber, 1 indicates Carbon fiber (MR-50R), 2 indicates Carbon fiber (T700), 3 indicates Carbon fiber (T700SC-12,000), 4 indicates Carbon fiber (T300-3000), 5 indicates Glass fiber (E-glass), 6 indicates Carbon fiber (T800S), 7 indicates Carbon fiber (AS4-W-12 K), 8 indicates Carbon fiber (T300), 9 indicates Glass fiber (GF1, Nufern®), and 10 indicates Polyester fiber. 
For the type of matrix, 1 indicates TriA-X polyimide (JAXA) resin, 2 indicates Epoxy (TDE86), 3 indicates polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), 4 indicates Epoxy resin, 5 indicates Epoxy resin (Epikote 828), 6 indicates Epoxy (bisphenol type-A, YD-128), 7 indicates Epoxy resin (TF1408), 8 indicates Resin (Araldite® LY 5052), 9 indicates Epoxy resin (105-A), and 10 indicates Poly phthalazinone ether ketone (PPEK).
