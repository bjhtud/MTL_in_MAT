This experiment focuses on the characterization of single weld bead geometry in robotic gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-based additive manufacturing. In the study, four key process parameters—wire feed rate, welding speed, arc voltage, and nozzle-to-plate distance—were systematically varied to fabricate individual weld beads. The resulting bead width was precisely measured using a laser structured light vision sensor.
