This is single-lap shear tests for fiber-reinforced polymer laminates externally bonded on concrete prisms. The input variables include the elastic modulus, tensile strength, thickness, and width of fiber-reinforced polymer laminates, as well as the bond length, and the concrete's compressive strength and width. The measured interfacial bond strength, represented by the interfacial bond strength load, serves as the target variable.
