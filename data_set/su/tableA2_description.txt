This is single-lap shear tests for fiber-reinforced polymer laminates externally bonded on concrete prisms. The input variables include the stiffness and width of fiber-reinforced polymer laminates, the concrete compressive strength, and the groove's width and depth. The measured interfacial bond strength, represented by the experimentally determined load, serves as the target variable.
