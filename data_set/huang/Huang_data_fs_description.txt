This experiment focuses on carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced cement composites. By systematically adjusting nine key parameters—including cement type, water-to-cement ratio, CNT content, external diameter, length, functionalization method, curing age, curing temperature, and dispersion method—multiple groups of samples with different compositions and processing conditions were prepared. The flexural strength of each sample was measured. Specifically, cement type 1 refers to ordinary Portland cement with Class 42.5 R, and cement type 2 refers to Portland cement with Class 52.5 R. For the functionalization method: 1 indicates no functionalization, 2 indicates functionalization in carboxyl solution, 3 indicates functionalization in hydroxyl solution, and 4 indicates functionalization in other acid solutions. For the dispersion method: 1 indicates no dispersion, 2 indicates sonication in polycarboxylate solution, 3 indicates sonication in TNWDIS (an aromatic modified polyethylene glycol ether), 4 indicates sonication in gum arabic, and 5 indicates sonication in water.
